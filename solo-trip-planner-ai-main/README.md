### 💡 *Project Title*: Budget Estimator for Solo Travel

### 📄 *Project Description*:

Traveling solo is liberating but comes with a unique challenge—*budgeting accurately* without the safety net of cost-sharing. The *Budget Estimator for Solo Travel* is an intelligent tool designed to help solo travelers plan and manage their trip expenses with confidence and clarity.

This project aims to develop a web or mobile application that allows users to *input key travel parameters—such as destination, duration, travel style (budget, mid-range, luxury), accommodation preference, food habits, transportation, and activities—to generate a **realistic, itemized estimate* of their total trip cost.

The tool leverages *real-time data* (via APIs or a dynamic backend database), *location-based pricing, and **custom travel preferences* to provide solo travelers with a personalized and optimized budget plan. It can also include options for *currency conversion, **expense breakdown, and **money-saving tips* based on the selected destination.
